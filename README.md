# Project Overview and System Design

## Overview

The core of our project is built on a web-based application using the RESTful design paradigm and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. We ensure that our development process is structured and well-organized by closely following these recognized procedures, which greatly improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our project.

We use a collection of web design and programming languages within this structure, which help us create and operate our system:

- **HTML**: Establishing the structural foundation of the website's user interface.
- **CSS**: Enhancing the visual aesthetics of the UI built with HTML.
- **Vite**: Facilitating rapid development and bundling of frontend assets.
- **React**: Employing component-based architecture to enrich the UI built with HTML.
- **Express + Node.js**: Serving as the backend logic handling framework.
- **JavaScript**: Powering dynamic form submission and client-side form validation.
- **MongoDB**: Managing and storing the application's data.
- **GitHub**: Utilizing version control for collaborative development and storing project codebase.

## Implementations

### Authentication

Our website provides easy user authentication, allowing users to register for individualized interactions within our application. We protect user data by using Firebase, a reliable third-party service, because security is our top priority. In addition to the ease with which users can log in through Gmail, Firebase's password recovery feature guarantees uninterrupted access in the event that users forget their passwords.

Our website offers a number of user-friendly features and comprehensive DIY car maintenance tutorials to help the people who use it. Users have access to thorough tutorials that are improved with clear, step-by-step directions, as well as images. Commenting by users is allowed at every step, encouraging participation and collaboration. Users can also add instructional icons, edit steps, and upload appropriate pictures to further personalize tutorials. Rearranging steps allows for greater customization and control for the user, which promotes a more individualized learning process.
